Today, he has submitted 42 PRs and resolved 31 Issues in both the main and the plugin repository. As an active community member, Lu Fei\u2019s contribution covers bug fixes, new features, and doc improvement. \\n\\nWe invite Lu Fei to share his journey with Apache Answer and we hope that his story can inspire more open-source enthusiasts. \\n\\n## Meet Apache Answer\\nBecoming a PPMC member of the Apache Answer incubator project means so much to me. It is more than a milestone, but a valuable open-source journey watching Answer grow from small project to a thriving community.\\n\\nI actually had a chance to join the SegmentFault team before Answer was even open-sourced, but things didn\'t work out. Looking back, I kind of kicked myself for missing out on this opportunity!\\n\\nOn October 24th 2022, Answer was launched and open sourced. When I saw that news, I jumped right in and checked on the repo. Then, I submitted my first [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/pull/2): `doc: update install`. Answer is built with Go and Node.js while I\u2019m a more of a PHP person, so I was swaying away from it. \\n\\nThe following year, Answer passed the vote and joined the ASF incubator. My second [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/pull/577): `fix: typo` was submitted by that time.\\n\\n![Answer Enters Incubator](ASF.png)\\n\\nThe WeChat group of SegmentFault was buzzing with congrats, while a question arose: \'When can I get my own @apache.org email?\' I muted the chat and got back to work but couldn\u2019t help thinking about that question.\\n\\n## Get to Know Apache Software Foundation\\nAfter Answer became a polling project, I started learning more about it and here\u2019s what I\u2019d love to share.\\n\\n![ASF 25 Years](ASF%2025%20Years.PNG)\\n\\n### The Apache Incubator\\nThe Apache Incubator was started in 2002 to help projects get ready to become part of the ASF. The ASF is huge\u2014it\'s the world\'s largest open-source foundation with thousands of contributors working on hundreds of projects. From web servers and big data to storage and machine learning, Apache software is everywhere. And it\'s all free to use!\\n\\nEach project in the incubator will be assigned with a few mentors who help guide them as they grow and become fully-fledged ASF projects. Once a project has met all the requirements, it can graduate and become a top-level project (TLP).\\n\\n### The Apache Way     \\n![Apache Way](Apache%20Way.PNG)\\nThe \\"Apache Way\\" is a core philosophy of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) that outlines a set of community governance principles for open-source projects. It emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and community-driven project management, ensuring that projects aren\'t controlled by a select few but are driven forward by a group of contributors. Here are some key principles of the \\"Apache Way\\":\\n\\n1. Community-Driven Development: Projects are driven by the community, not individuals or companies.\\n2. Transparency: All discussions and decisions are open to everyone. It is typically done through mailing lists or public discussion platforms.\\n3. Consensus-Based Decision Making: Important decisions are made through consensus. This minuses confrontational disagreements while ensuring that most of the community supports key changes to the project.\\n4. Respect and Inclusion: A welcoming environment for all contributors.\\n5. Contributor-driven: Everyone has the opportunity to take on greater responsibilities through contributions. The progression from Contributor to Committer to PMC Member (Project Management Committee) is based on contributions and community trust.\\n\\nBy following these principles, Apache projects foster collaboration, innovation, and long-term sustainability.\\n\\n## Becoming a Committer\\nI was hooked on Apache Answer because of its tech stack. As a developer eager to learn Go, this was the perfect opportunity to put my skills into practice. I started with `good first issue` which was a great way to get my feet wet. I started with some simple tasks, like fixing typos and adding small features. \\n\\nThe community was incredibly supportive, and with their guidance, I gradually gained a deeper understanding of the project\'s architecture. As my Go skills improved, so did my contributions. I was thrilled when I was invited to become a Committer in June 2024. After signing the ICLA, I couldn\'t wait to have my Apache account!\\n\\n![Invitation to Become Answer Committer](Invitation%20of%20Committer.png)\\n\\nOn June 27, 2024, I received the email: Welcome to the Apache Software Foundation, and it was the time to unlock my ASF committer account.\\n\\n![Welcome to ASF](Welcome%20to%20ASF.png)\\n\\nJust a week later, on July 8th, I was added to the Apache Answer Committer list. Becoming a Committer is more than an identity, but taking on more responsibilities, including code reviews, quality checks, and helping new contributors. \\n\\n## From Committer to PPMC Member\\nBecoming a Committer made me even more invested in Apache Answer. Beyond active participation in mailing lists and voting on releases, I started diving into issues, tackling bug fixes and feature enhancements. I also [contributed new plugins](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asy-records+is%3Aclosed), such as [Tencent COS Storage](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/storage-tencentyuncos), [DingTalk Notifications](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/notification-dingtalk), and [Baidu Reviewer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/reviewer-baidu).\\n\\nBeing nominated for PPMC was both exciting and humbling. As a PPMC member, I\u2019ll be working closely with the community to guide the project\'s direction, ensure we\'re following the Apache Way, and attract more developers. It\'s a big responsibility, but I\'m thrilled to be a part of it.\\n\\n## Join the Community \\nApache Answer is a dynamic community. Whether you\'re a seasoned pro or just starting out, there\u2019s always a space for you. Every part of Apache Answer, from its design to its code, is the work of talented people like you.\\n\\nIf you\'re into Q&A platform or open source, you should definitely check it out. Start small, maybe by fixing a typo or improving some documentation. You\'ll quickly learn the ropes and start making a real impact.\\n\\nI want to give a huge shout-out to the amazing Apache Answer community. Your support has been incredible, and I\'m excited to see where we go next."},{"id":"/2024/11/13/how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/13/how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-11-13-how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-13-how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive/index.md","title":"How Release Managers Make the Release Process Productive","description":"Learn the behind-the-scenes story of how four Release Managers gradually optimized the release process.","date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 13, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":4.28,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How Release Managers Make the Release Process Productive","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Community","featured":true,"image":"2024-11-13-cover@4x.png","description":"Learn the behind-the-scenes story of how four Release Managers gradually optimized the release process."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Lu Fei\'s ASF Journey: From Contributor to PPMC Member","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/22/lufei-asf-journey-from-contributor-to-ppmc-member"},"nextItem":{"title":"Recap of October | Apache Answer","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/04/answer-recap-october"}},"content":"An Apache release follows a rigorous process with valid, signed, artifacts, voted on by the appropriate PMC and ultimately distributed on the official ASF release infrastructure. Each project designates a committer to be release manager for release preparation, execution, and document maintenance, etc. Apache encourages committers to take turns in this role for different release, ensuring release quality, efficiency, and process optimization.\\n\\nSince joining the Apache Incubator in October 2023, Apache Answer has released 8 Apache versions with 4 release managers involved. With their help, the project has accumulated Apache release experience. The process of merging code and packaging has become smoother, the Release doc includes more details, and the recent added email templates make writing voting emails easier.\\n\\nIn today\'s read, we will look back at the challenges encountered by the release managers during the release, how they solved them, and how they improved the release documentation and the release process.\\n\\n## Evolution of the Release Doc \\nAs the foundation of the release, the release doc provides detailed guidance. It also serves as a testament to the project\u2019s maturity and independence in release management.\\n\\nLinkinStars, a backend engineer, became Apache Answer\u2019s [first release manager](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2024/03/18/meet-our-release-manager-linkinstars). He crafted the initial version of the release doc with an entire release cycle and final deployment. In this version, the release doc packed with process from packaging, signing, verification, and uploading, as well as email templates. With his help, Apache Answer\u2019s [first Apache release](https://answer.apache.org/zh-CN/blog/2023/12/07/a-new-chapter-begins-answer-first-apache-release-launches) was successfully launched on November 29th, 2023.\\n\\nLater on, the PPMC members started to take turns following the guidance of the mentor. By rotating this role, the community was not only familiarized with the release process but also able to identify the optimization gap. \\n\\nAs the frontend developer of Apache Answer, shuai built Apache Answer\u2019s frontend from scratch. He took up the torch and became the second release manager. During the release process, he enhanced the doc by elaborating of GPG keys, methods of file verification, and ways to obtain email links.\\n\\n![Alt text](shuai-sign-the-release-artifacts.PNG)\\n\\n\\nKumfo has taken over from shuai as the third release manager for Apache Answer. As a backend developer, he contributed to the development of features related to reputation, upvoting, and other event-driven functionalities. He made modifications and additions based on feedback from IPMC Members.\\n\\n![kumfo\'s contribution](kumfo-improvement.PNG)\\n\\nCurrently, the baton for releasing Apache Answer has passed to robin. He has made more detailed revisions to the documentation, such as breaking down some release steps, adding more details, and reorganizing the structure of the document for better clarity and sequence.\\n\\n![robin\'s update](how-to-release.PNG)\\n\\nRead the latest [release docs](https://answer.apache.org/community/how-to-release) proudly presented and polished by the release managers.\\n\\n## Challenges and Solutions\\nFor LinkinStars, the first release was undoubtedly a huge challenge. He first worked with other PPMC members to collect and organize the relevant release documentation, creating an initial release process.\\n\\n![Alt text](release-process.PNG)\\n\\nClick [here](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/13/behind-the-scene-how-we-launched-the-first-apache-release) to learn more about the behind-the-scenes story of Apache Answer\'s first Apache release.\\n\\nAfter shuai\u2018s take-over, he referred to LinkinStars\u2019 release documentation and prepared the GPG key and SVN configuration in advance. However, he still faced issues such as incorrect email subject/content, missing content after packaging, and incorrect signatures. To avoid formatting errors caused by copy-pasting in emails, shuai suggested creating a .txt file locally first, where the email template can be edited and modified before copying it into the email editor. He also created a [GitHub repo of Apache release email templates](https://github.com/shuashuai/apache-release-email) to help other release managers avoid encountering such problems in the future.\\n\\nWhen waiting for a General vote takes longer than expected, a REMINDER email can be sent for kindly notice. However, it is recommended to prioritize seeking vote from mentors.\\n\\n![Alt text](reminder-tips.png)\\n\\nIn the Apache community, all communication is transparent and traceable, which is incredibly helpful for Release Managers referencing past Apache project release processes and emails. The community atmosphere at Apache is open and friendly, and when issues arise, someone will point them out and help resolve them in the emails. For example, during the General vote phase, a mentor pointed out that the release files uploaded to the SVN repository were incorrect, with the signed files having a size of 0. After several rounds of checks, it was found that the release manager had not properly downloaded the release files, and the browser had restricted the content, causing the downloaded files to be incorrect.\\n\\nWhen talking to the release managers, all of them have mentioned the importance of collaboration and cooperation among release managers. Besides meticulous and repeated checks during the release, it is highly recommended to invite other release managers to help validate the release to ensure that every step is correct.\\n\\nOne of the graduation checklist items in Apache\'s successful graduation guide is the ability to release an Apache version. This requires not only clear release documentation and a transparent communication mechanism but also the collective effort of all community members. From requirement analysis, development, and testing to the final release, the collaboration among community members is key to ensuring a successful release. Apache Answer welcomes and encourages more people to join the community to help build a better Q&A platform software together."},{"id":"/2024/11/04/answer-recap-october","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/04/answer-recap-october","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-11-04-answer-recap-october/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-04-answer-recap-october/index.md","title":"Recap of October | Apache Answer","description":"October brings an award and community love.","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 4, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.025,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Recap of October | Apache Answer","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Newsletter","featured":true,"image":"2024-11-04-cover@4x.png","description":"October brings an award and community love."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How Release Managers Make the Release Process Productive","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/13/how-release-managers-make-the-release-process-productive"},"nextItem":{"title":"Recap of September | Apache Answer","permalink":"/blog/2024/10/01/answer-recap-sept"}},"content":"Hope you enjoyed the spooky vibe of the Halloween.

It thrives on diversity and that\'s why we believe that there\'s always a place for you. Whether you\'re a seasoned developer or just getting started, your contributions-code, documentations, or shining ideas-are valuable.\\n\\nTo make it easier for beginners, we\'ve listed our projects on platforms like [ovio](https://ovio.org/project/apache/incubator-answer), [LibHunt](https://www.libhunt.com/r/incubator-answer), and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/incubator-answer/) for easier discovery. We\'re glad to have received a plugin contribution from [Melody](https://github.com/IamMelody233) and her classmate from Xiamen University Malaysia Campus. It\'s their first open-source contribution, and let\'s hear about the process and their reflection.\\n\\n## Tell us more about the plugin.\\n\\nWe\'ve built a [code highlighting plugin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/render-markdown-codehighlight) using React and highlight.js. The plugin offers real-time syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages and supports dynamic theme switching. Users can choose from popular themes like GitHub Light and GitHub Dark, or create their own custom themes.\\n\\n## How did you break down the development of this plugin?\\n\\nThere are several phases as below. First, we started with a simple implementation of code highlighting in the project itself. Once this was working, we moved forward to transforming it into a single plugin.\\n\\nSince plugins mostly deal with the front-end stuff, we focused on that first. After we got the basic highlighting running, we added customization which allows users to choose their preferred theme from the backend. To make that happen, we set up an interface between the front-end and back-end.\\n\\nTo sum up:\\n1. Import highlight.js and implement basic code highlighting on the front-end.\\n2. Migrate the code highlighting feature into a plugin. Well, Vite\'s bundling got in the way of importing all the CSS we needed, so we had to use CSS-in-JS instead.\\n3. We noticed that switching to the light theme and the preview box under Question weren\'t working smoothly. So, we tweaked some dependencies and added more responsive listeners to fix it\\n4. Once the front-end was stable, we turned our attention to the backend. We created a form for users to select their preferred themes.\\n5. By modifying the frontend-backend interface, we were able to dynamically apply the selected themes.\\n6. When testing, we identified performance issues related to CSS loading. To optimize performance, we switched to a dynamic import and mapping approach to reduce CSS load times.\\n7.  Finally, for better maintainability and readability, we wrote code to parse the core library and automate theme detection, classification, and switching.\\"\\n\\n## How do you solve the problems encoutered in the process?\\n\\nYes, there were a few challenges during development. For instance:\\n\\n-   **CSS Loading:** Importing multiple CSS stylesheets was a problem because of Vite\'s packaging limitations. We overcame this by adopting a CSS-in-JS solution.\\n-   **Theme Switching:** The preview box below the Question wasn\'t in real-time rendering when switching between light and dark modes. To resolve this, we optimized dependencies and implemented more robust event listeners.\\n-   **Backend Integration:** Integrating the backend form with the frontend was another hurdle. We solved this by leveraging the Answer API to facilitate data exchange between the front-end and back-end.\\n-   **Code Maintenance:** To streamline future maintenance, we implemented file traversal to read the core library instead of manual imports.\\n\\nBy addressing these issues, we were able to enhance the plugin\'s performance and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.\\n\\n## What new insights have we gained about the open-source community?\\n\\nWorking on open-source projects has taught us the importance of community and collaboration. Every little thing you do, like writing code or sharing ideas, helps make Answer better. It\'s not just about knowing how to code; you also need to be good at talking to other people. When you work together, you can make sure everything works right, especially when fixing problems.\\n\\nWe\'ve learned that having great coding skills isn\'t enough. You need to really understand how the project works inside and out. That means learning from others and using their ideas. Open source isn\'t just about sharing tech; it\'s about sharing ideas and being creative. It helps everyone get better and makes us want to do our best\\n\\n## How would you encourage students to participate in open source projects?\\n\\nWorking on these projects has helped us truly understand how open source works and the importance of teamwork. We think students should definitely get involved in open source projects. It\'s a great way to learn and practice coding.\\n\\nBy contributing, students can get real-world experience, solve real problems, and meet other people in tech. Start small and work your way up. Whether you write code, document things, or test stuff, there\'s a place for everyone. Open source can help you learn new things and add testimonials for your skills on your resume.\\n\\nThese two students didn\'t just write code; they went the extra mile! They created guides to help others set things up and contributed blog posts about how to configure the [frontend](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2024/08/16/apache-answer-frontend-configuration-guide) and [backend](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2024/08/20/apache-answer-backend-configuration-guide), as well as [add new plugins](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2024/08/22/guide-to-add-answer-plugins). Plus, they updated and translated the docs to make them easier to understand for Chinese speakers.\\n\\nWe\'re so grateful for their hard work! We hope more students will join us in making open source a welcoming place. There are lots of ways to get involved, even if you\'re not a coder.

This article will provide a detailed guide on how to configure the backend of Apache Answer. We will go through each step, ensuring that everyone can get started and run the backend successfully.\\n\\n## Preparation\\n\\n1. Download Golang\\n    Download and install the Go programming language from the [official website](https://go.dev/doc/install). Follow the default settings for installation.\\n\\n2. Clone the Answer Project\\n    Ensure that you have cloned the Apache Answer project locally. If you haven\u2019t done so yet, please refer to the [Apache Answer Frontend Configuration Guide](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2024/08/16/apache-answer-frontend-configuration-guide).\\n\\n\\n## I. Initialize the Project\\n\\nOpen the command line terminal in the root directory of the Answer project and run the following commands:\\n```\\ngo mod download\\ngo run cmd/answer/main.go init -C ./answer-data\\n```\\n_Note: If the first command doesn\'t work, try running the second one. The process may take some time, please be patient._\\n\\n![go success](go-success.png)\\nWhen you see [SUCCESS], means the operation has done. **Do not close this program at this time.** Enter the prompted URL `http://localhost:80/install/` in your web browser to open and proceed with the next step of the installation.\\n\\n_Note: If you cannot find the localhost page when opening the URL, try running the following command first and then retry:_\\n```\\ncd ./ui\\npnpm pre-install\\npnpm install\\npnpm build\\ncd ..\\n```\\n\\n\\n## II. Installation Interface\\n\\nOpen `http://localhost:80/install/`, and you will see the following interface. The first step is to choose the language.\\n![install1](install1.png)\\n\\n### 2.1 Configure the Database\\n\\nYou can create an Answer database using your own database software.\\nApache Answer supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite as database backends. The smallest environment requirement is SQLite, which doesn\'t need any additional configuration.\\nIf you plan to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need to **set up the database first** and then configure the database connection in this step.\\n![install2](install2.png)\\n\\n**This article will use MySQL as an example.**\\n\\n#### Create a Database\\n\\nIn the `MySQL command line`, create a database named `answer`:\\n![create database](database.png)\\n\\n#### Configure the Database Connection\\n\\nVisit `http://localhost:80/install/`, and enter your database connection information in the installation interface:\\n- User name: root\\n- Database host: 127.0.0.1:3306\\n- Password: your database password\\n![database settings](database2.png)\\n\\n### 2.2 Create a Configuration File\\n\\nIn the installation interface, follow the prompts to create a `config.yaml` file.\\n![install3](install3.png)\\n\\n### 2.3 Set Website Information and Administrator Account\\n\\nMake sure to remember the website URL (e.g., `http://localhost`) and the administrator account information and password, as you will need them for future logins.\\n![install4](install4.png)\\n\\n### 2.4 Complete the Installation\\n![install5](install5.png)\\n\\n\\n## III. Run the Backend\\n\\nBack to the `command line terminal`, and in the root directory of the Answer project, run the following command to start the backend server:\\n```\\ngo run cmd/answer/main.go run -C ./answer-data\\n```\\n\\n\\n## IV. Verify the Installation\\n\\nIn your web browser, visit the website URL you set up (e.g., `http://localhost`). Log in with your administrator account. If you see the following page, the configuration is successful:\\n![answer page](answer-page.png)\\n\\n\\nBy following these steps, you have successfully set up the Apache Answer backend.

We had the privilege of participating in two incredible events: [WeAreDev World Congress 2024](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress) and [CommunityOverCode Asia 2024](https://asia.communityovercode.org/).\\n\\nWe were grateful to be given these chances. In this blog, we would love to share tips here for more open-source projects showcasing themselves on the stage next time. \\n\\n## WeAreDev World Congress GitHub Open Source Spotlight \\nAs world\u2019s leading event for developers and tech decision-makers, WeAreDev World Congress welcomes more than 15,000 developers and over 500 speakers sharing their expertise and visions of future trends in modern software development. \\n\\n![Alt text](WeAreDev%20World%20Congress.JPG)\\n\\nThis year, GitHub Open Source Spotlight was a part of this congress. We submitted our application and were chosen and offered a space at GitHub booth. It was an unbelievable opportunity to showcase Apache Answer to a global audience of over 15,000 developers and tech leaders. Not to mention, with other brilliant open-source projects. \\n\\n![Alt text](GitHub%20Open%20Source%20Spotlight%20Area.jpeg)\\n\\nThe event provided a valuable opportunity to showcase Answer to potential users, contributors, and industry experts. We gained valuable insights and feedback that will help us shape Answer in a better way. Guess what, we even met several users from Germany!\\n\\n![Alt text](Answer%20at%20GitHub%20Open%20Source%20Spotlight.jpeg)\\n\\n## CommunityOverCode Asia 2024\\nCommunityOverCode (formly known as ApacheCon) is the official global conference series of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Since 1998 \u2013 before the ASF\u2019s incorporation \u2013 ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore \\"Tomorrow\u2019s Technology Today\\" across 300+ Apache projects and their diverse communities. CommunityOverCode showcases the latest developments in Apache projects and emerging innovations through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, and more.\\n\\n![Alt text](CoC%20Asia%202024.jpg)\\n\\nWe had a booth and 3 speeches in keynote, incubator, and community track. We were happy to catch up with our mentors. At the booth, our committers were grateful to connect and answer questions with committers from other Apache projects.\\n\\n\\n## Tips for Better Showcasing Your Projects Events\\nHere, we would love to share some tips for more open-source projects to prepare and show their projects in their next big event. \\n\\n### Share on Social Media \\nMake the best use of social media to extend the reach, especially for global community members. Send an event preview, schedule, and invitation to your followers to drop by and connect. \\n\\n![Alt text](Event%20Preview.png)\\n\\nDuring the event, greet, share the location, and tell them you\u2019ll be staying in the coming days on social media. Check out how our open-source neighbor Open Feature did on day 1 of the congress. \\n\\n![Alt text](Open%20Feature%20Tweet.png)\\n\\n### Show Your Project with a Demo\\nIn GitHub Open Source Spotlight area, we were offered a table with space for a laptop and keyboard connected to a display. \\n\\nA live demo is invaluable, and Meta Answer is the demo already. We ran [Meta Answer\xa0](https://meta.answer.dev/)directly for visitors to explore and we can respond to their questions or record suggestion during the process.\\n\\n![Alt text](Demo%20on%20Display.jpg)\\n\\nIf there\u2019s no connected display on the booth, feel free to bring a portable display, or simply run it on your laptop.\\n\\n![Alt text](Demo%20on%20Laptop.png)\\n\\n### Prepare Some Takeaways\\nWhile the demo is a live experience for the visitors, prepare takeaways for them to recall your project. Flyers and several stickers are efficient. \\n\\nFlyers can provide a quick overview of your project. You can include highlights, social media accounts, and fun facts on the flyers. Stickers are a fun way to leave a lasting impression, and a way to promote your product on the surface of a laptop. \\n\\n![Alt text](Flyer.png)\\n\\nRushing for our flight, we left a \\"help yourself\\" note with our flyers and stickers.\\n\\n![Alt text](Help%20Yourself.png)\\n\\nYou can also make pins, badge, or mug based on the budget. In CommunityOverCode 2024, the fridge magnets at [GreptimeDB](https://greptime.com/) booth were a delight by the look and value.\\n\\n![Alt text](Magnet%20from%20GreptimeDB.png)\\n\\n### Jot Down the Notes\\nListen and record questions, suggestions, and feedback. Categorize and share it with the community. Ask community members to discuss or leave the answers, and vote for the best answers. Gradually, you will have a FAQ list for your next event so that whoever participates the conference can prepare in advance for the questions. \\n\\n*Sounds familiar, right? Answer is a great tool for this.*\\n\\n## See You on Stage\\nWe hope these tips help your open-source project shine at the next big event. Remember, it\'s all about making meaningful connections and showcasing the value you bring to the developer community.\\n\\nParticipating in these events was unforgettable for our team, and we\'re excited to continue contributing to the open-source ecosystem.\\n\\nPlease don\'t hesitate to reach out to us through our [social media](https://x.com/AnswerDev) or our [community](https://meta.answer.dev/)."},{"id":"/2024/08/01/answer-recap-july","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/08/01/answer-recap-july","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-08-01-answer-recap-july/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-01-answer-recap-july/index.mdx","title":"Recap of July | Apache Answer","description":"July was a month all about community love.","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":2.205,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Recap of July | Apache Answer","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Newsletter","featured":false,"image":"2024-08-01-cover@4x.png","description":"July was a month all about community love."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reflection and Our Tips for Your Next Open-Source Events","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/14/reflection-and-tips-for-your-next-open-source-events"},"nextItem":{"title":"Join Apache Answer at CommunityOverCode Asia 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/11/apache-answer-coc-asia-2024"}},"content":"Another page turns, and it was a busy month with some petit milestones.

It might be frustrating since the doc [using plugins](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/) doesn\u2019t contain successful packaging examples. \\n\\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll guide you through the process of packing your Answer plugin with step-by-step tutorial. \\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nTo get started, please make sure you have a development environment set up with the following: Node.js, pnpm, Docker, Go etc. Don\u2019t forget to check the official documentation for [development guide](https://answer.apache.org/docs/development/).\\n\\n## Notice\\n\\n**Skip this section if you\u2019re using the latest code.**\\n\\nIn Answer 1.3.5, the plugin build process and some plugin commands have been adjusted. If you are using code from before 1.3.5, you need to change the basic information of some internal plugins. The plugins involved are:\\n\\n1. editor-chart\\n2. editor-formula\\n3. embed-basic (only available 1.3.5 and later)\\n\\nFind the [commit ID](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/commit/e224fee9b8a0b936e143e852050d9345aa249201) for the plugin you need to update. In its package.json files, the hyphens (-) in the plugin name with underscores (\\\\_). For instance:\\n![image.png](01.webp)\\n\\n## I. Build Docker Images with Plugins\\nThere\u2019re two ways to build Docker images with plugins:\\n1. Answer Base Image\\n2. Local Code\\n\\n\\n### Build from Answer Base Image \\nIf there\u2019s no need to modify Answer\'s source code, you can build directly from official base images. Please check our [docs](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/#build-with-plugin-from-answer-base-image) on building with plugin from answer base image.\\n\\n### Build Docker Images From Local Code\\nPlease keep local code up-to-date. The steps are as below:\\n\\n1. **Add Pluins**\uff1aEdit `/script/plugin_list` (root directory) and add plugin repository URLs (one per line).\\n2. **Build Docker Image**\uff1aRun command: `docker build -t <image_name[:tag]> .` .\\n3. **Launch and Verify**\uff1aWait for build to finish, then run `docker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name <container_name> <image_name>`, then verify plugins in Answer \u3002\\n\\n### 1.Add Required Plugins\\n```\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/reviewer-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/captcha-basic@latest\\ngithub.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/editor-formula@latest\\n\\n```\\n\\n### 2.Build Docker Image\\n\\nThe build process may take some time.\\n![docker build process](docker-build.webp)\\n\\n### 3.Local Start up and Verification\\nRun the following command to start locally and follow the [documentation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation#install-steps) to complete initialization. \\n\\n```\\ndocker run -d -p 9080:80 -v answer-data:/data --name answer101 answer-plugin\\n```\\n\\nAfter initialization, log in to the admin panel and see if the plugin runs correctly.\\n\\nAdmin Panel\\n![installed plugins](installed-plugins.webp)\\n\\nActivate the Plugin\\n![active a plugin](active-plugin.webp)\\n\\nVerify Plugin(editor-formula) Functionality\uff1a\\n![confirm formula plugin result](formula-res.webp)\\n\\n\\n## II. Build a Binary with Plugins\\n\\nHere, we will walk you through the process of building an Apache Answer binary that includes specific plugins. The process involves building the base binary, incorporating the required plugins, locally verifying the plugins, and finally deploying the binary.\\n\\n### Steps   \\n1. Build Base Binary\\n2. Build Plugin Binary\\n3. Verify\\n4. Deploy\\n\\n### 1.Build Base Binary\\n\\nStart with building the front-end static resources using the command `make ui`.\\n\\nOutput:\\n1. Installing Dependencies\\n![install ui dependence](make-ui-01.webp)\\n2. Dependency InstallationBuilding Static Resources after Dependency Installation\\n![build ui static files](make-ui-02.webp)\\n\\nTo build the base binary, run `make build`. If the build is successful, the answer binary will be generated in the project root directory.\\n\\nIf you encounter errors related to Go dependency installation, you can try running `go mod download` locally to see if the installation is successful. If it still fails, consider configuring a domestic mirror: https://goproxy.cn/ or enabling a network proxy.\\n\\nSuccess\uff1a\\n![build binary success](make-ui-03.webp)\\n\\n### 2.Build a Binary File with the Required Plugins Using the Base Binary File\\n\\nPlease view [Answer plugin docs](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins/#binary-build).\\n```\\n# answer build --with [plugin@plugin_version=[replacement]] --output [file]\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n\\n# build a new answer with github login plugin then output to ./new_answer.\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github@1.0.0 --output ./new_answer\\n\\n# with multiple plugins\\n$ ./answer build \\\\\\n--with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github \\\\\\n--with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-google\\n\\n# with local plugins\\n$ ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github@1.0.0=/my-local-space\\n\\n# cross compilation. Build a linux-amd64 binary in macos\\n$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n\\n# specify the answer version using ANSWER_MODULE environment variable\\n$ ANSWER_MODULE=github.com/apache/incubator-answer@v1.2.0-RC1 ./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github\\n```\\n\\nYou can choose the required plugins according to the instructions in the documentation. Compiling plugins will rebuild the front-end static resources. Plugins may have special dependencies, so dependency installation and compilation will be performed again here. After successful compilation, the `new_answer` binary file will be generated in the dist directory.\\n\\n\\nExample:\\n![new answer binary](new-answer.webp)\\n\\n#### 2.1.Build Single Plugin \\n\\n\\n`./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/connector-github`\\n\\nEffect:\\n![build progress](2.1.1.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.1.2.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.1.3.webp)\\n\\nVerify plugin installation command: `./new_answer plugin`.\\n\\n![confirm result](2.1.4.webp)\\n\\n\\n#### 2.2.Build Single Plugin Using Local Plugin Code \\nIf you need to modify some plugin information or build a plugin using your own private implementation, you need to use the command `with local plugins`. For example, the `editor-formula` plugin mentioned above is compatible with Answer versions below 1.3.5, so you need to modify some plugin information. In this case, you can use the following command to build the plugin:\\n\\n`./answer build --with github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/editor-formula@0.0.3=/Users/shuai/answer/plugins/editor-formula`\\n\\nOutput:\\n![build progress](2.2.1.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.2.2.webp)\\n\\n![build progress](2.2.3.webp)\\n\\nVerify plugin installation command: `./new_answer plugin`.\\n\\n![confirm result](2.2.4.webp)\\n\\n\\n#### 2.3.Build Multiple Plugins  \\nThe process for building multiple plugins is similar to building a single plugin. Please kindly refer to building single plugin and try it yourself.\\n\\n\\n### 3.Verify Plugins Locally   \\nUsing the command line only ensures that the plugins have been installed. To check if the plugins are running correctly, you can run the generated binary file locally. Please refer to the [installation documentation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation) for instructions on initializing the information. \\n![installation docs](installation.webp)\\n\\nPlease pay attention that you need to run the new_answer binary, so replace ./answer with ./new_answer in the command line.\\n\\n\\n### 4.Steps for Local Verification\\n\\n1. Initialization Complete    \\nFor example: `INSTALL_PORT=80 ./new_answer init -C ./answer-data`\\n\\n![local init](local-init.webp)\\n\\nAccess [http://localhost:80/install/](http://localhost:80/install/) and follow the [instructions](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation#install-steps) to complete the initialization process. \\n\\n2. Update Information     \\nRun the command  `./new_answer upgrade -C ./answer-data/` \\n\\n3. Start the Local Website   \\n    Run `./new_answer run -C ./answer-data/`\uff0c access `http://localhost/`. Log in and go `http://localhost/admin` to activate and verify the plugin.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example of editor-formula plugin.\\n\\n![installed formula](installed-formula.webp)\\n![image.png](formula-res.webp)\\n\\nAt this point, you can make sure that the plugin has been built correctly and running.\\n\\n\\n### 5.Deploy the Binary\\n\\nIf your website is deployed using a binary, you can now deploy the generated binary file. If you need to adapt to different platforms, you can use the cross-compilation commands in the documentation to build the binary file."},{"id":"/2024/07/01/answer-recap-june","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/01/answer-recap-june","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-07-01-answer-recap-june/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-01-answer-recap-june/index.md","title":"Recap of June | Apache Answer","description":"An official farewell to the first half year of 2024 as the curtain of June falls.","date":"2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Recap of June | Apache Answer","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Newsletter","featured":false,"image":"2024-07-01-cover@4x.png","description":"An official farewell to the first half year of 2024 as the curtain of June falls."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Package and Deploy Answer Plugins","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/02/how-to-package-and-deploy-answer-plugins"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Search Like a Pro in Answer","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/20/how-to-search-like-a-pro-in-answer"}},"content":"As the curtain of June falls, we officially farewell to the first half of the year of 2024.

As you type the first letter of the moderator or admin\'s username, a search bar will appear. Select the admin/moderator from the dropdown list for a faster response. \\n\\n![Mention Moderator and Admins](Mention%20Moderators%20and%20Admin.png)\\n\\nThe moderator and admins will receive an email in their email box.\\n\\n\\n### Shining on Social Platforms\\nSocial media meta tag is on the stage!

That\u2019s why I am here. \\n\\nThis role itself requires lots of patience and carefulness. Each package needs to be carefully checked to ensure that all the required files are correct and compliant. Release managers have a lot on their plate, since the releasing problems will lead to user upgrade or usage issues.\\n\\n## Can you briefly walk us through the release process? Which stages are more critical?\\nSure. The release process of Apache Answer consists of the following stages.\\n\\n![Release Process of Apache Answer](release-process.png)\\n\\nThe most important stage is actually the **preparation**. It involves preparation and review of all the content that needs to be released. We have to check and review the open-source requirements, license, signature, etc. If this stage is not well checked, we cannot pass the voting afterward.\\n\\n## Which tools/platforms do you use to release?\\nWe use GitHub Actions to build the packages and release.\\n\\n## What are the key factors for a successful release?\\nThe 2 key factors for a successful release are:\\n\\n**Check once, check twice, and check from the top again.**\\n**Test, test again, and another round of tests.**\\n\\nNo worries, as soon as you have released the first Apache version, things get easier and smoother. \\n\\n## How do you prioritize the tasks in the release process?\\nHandling multiple tasks happens occasionally, and here\u2019s how I manage them.\\n\\nOnce we decide to release the version, and there might still be new issues coming from the users. In this case, if there\u2019s no urgent bugs that need to be fixed, we will put them into the to-dos of the next version and move on. \\n\\n## How do you handle \\"unexpected events\\" during the release process?\\nSeek help from the mentors.        \\nI will ask them to locate the problem and help with the review. Then, we will fix it, and re-initiate the voting. \\n\\n## Can you share one of the most difficult challenges you faced during the release process, and how did you nail it?\\nThe most enduring challenge I faced was the first release. I had no idea about preparation, what to expect, and what\u2019s next. Here\u2019s how I manage to overcome the challenges with the team.\\n1. Collect and organize all the documents related to Apache releases.\\n2. Look into the release notes and emails of other Apache projects for reference.\\n3. Seek help from the mentors via emails.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to **keep trying**. The Apache community is friendly, and community members will remind you with assistance. Be brave, and embrace the mistakes. \\n\\n*Find out how we launched the first Apache Release [here](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/13/behind-the-scene-how-we-launched-the-first-apache-release).*\\n\\n## What are some strategies/tips you have for working effectively with your team during the release process?\\n1. Use GitHub issues and projects to manage all the released content, and then check one by one with each team member.\\n\\n2. Provide as much context as possible when describing an issue. This is particularly useful in email communication, as the more context leads to less misunderstanding and saves time.   \\n\\n## What do you find most rewarding about being a Release Manager?\\nIt\'s fulfilling to fix all the problems in a project after rounds of revisions, and a successful release. To receive feedback from the users is absolutely rewarding."},{"id":"/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-02-20-answer-1.2.5-is-ready/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-20-answer-1.2.5-is-ready/index.md","title":"Answer 1.2.5 is Ready","description":"Answer supports dark mode and plugin notification.

How can I do that?\\n\\n## Background\\nWhen you already have a server, you may want to deploy Answer on it. After deploying Answer, you will realize that you can only access it using HTTP. However, you may want to access it using HTTPS. So how can you do that? \\n\\nSome questions:\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1G3/how-to-configure-ssl\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1wh/how-to-enable-ssl\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1XG2/how-to-deploy-answer-image-in-aws-in-docker-with-ssl-and-nginx\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D136/how-to-deploy-an-ssl-certificate-using-docker-and-how-to-access-it-without-using-a-port\\n- https://meta.answer.dev/questions/D1Oe/i-have-set-up-ssl-on-cloudflare-but-still-can-t-access-via-https\\n- ...\\n\\nI found that many people have this question. Deploying Answer is easy, but deploying it with HTTPS is a bit difficult. So I decided to write this article to help you deploy Answer with HTTPS.\\n\\n## Easy way\\nThis blog aims to introduce the easiest way to deploy Answer with HTTPS. You can use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) to deploy Answer with HTTPS. Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go. Of course, you can use other tools to deploy Answer with HTTPS, such as Nginx, etc.\\n\\n## Preparation\\n1. You can follow the [installation guide](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation/) to install Answer. After installing Answer, you can access it using HTTP. The default port for Answer is 9080. You can access it at http://localhost:9080. In the following steps, we will use 9080 as the default port for Answer.\\n\\n2. You need a domain that **DNS resolution is already configured to point to your server**.\\n\\n3. In this blog we will use docker-compose to install Caddy. So we need docker and docker-compose. You can follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install docker and docker-compose.\\n\\n## Deploy \\n\\n### Step 1\\n```shell\\n$ mkdir caddy-docker\\n$ cd caddy-docker\\n$ vim docker-compose.yml\\n```\\nYou can create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the new directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"docker-compose.yml\\"\\nversion: \\"3.7\\"\\n\\nservices:\\n  caddy:\\n    image: caddy\\n    restart: unless-stopped\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"80:80\\"\\n      - \\"443:443\\"\\n      - \\"443:443/udp\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\\n      - $PWD/caddy_data:/data\\n      - $PWD/caddy_config:/config\\n    network_mode: host\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2\\nThe `Caddyfile` is the configuration file for Caddy. It is used to configure how Caddy should serve your site. This file will be mounted into the container at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ vim Caddyfile\\n```\\nCreate `Caddyfile` file in the same directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3\\n\\nRun the following command to start Caddy. Wait a few seconds, and then you can access Answer using HTTPS.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose up -d\\n```\\n\\nIf you can\'t access it, you can check the logs of Caddy.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose logs\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced\\nIf you don\'t want to use `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml`, you can put Answer and Caddy in the same docker compose. Then Caddy and Answer can use the same network. So you can configure Caddy like this:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy answer-service:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOf course, you can also install Caddy using other methods, such as using the binary file, etc. All in all, I wish you can follow this blog to deploy Answer with HTTPS successfully. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a question on [Meta](https://meta.answer.dev/). We will try our best to help you."},{"id":"/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2024-01-25-first-contribution-come-to-answer/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-25-first-contribution-come-to-answer/index.md","title":"First Contribution?

We all have new questions or new answers at the beginning of the year, and feel free to raise your hand in the first release of Answer in 2024.\\n\\nIn this version, we pack up new features and improvements to make finding answers easier, reduce duplicate content, and an efficient way of organizing your Q&A knowledge from the very start. \\n\\n## One Answer. One Question.\\nAnswer focuses on clear and concise answers to each question. However, you can find new answers or scattered answers from one person in several responses, making it hard for the admin to pick the best answer, and maintain the content afterwards. \\n\\nWe\'ve streamlined things so everyone can write or edit one, top-notch answer to each question. This helps users focus on contributing their expertise, and lets the best answer shine.\\n\\n### How to\\nThis feature is on by default, and admin can switch it off anytime. \\n1. Go Admin - Settings - Write.\\n2. Switch the button.\\n\\n![Switch on One Answer Only](one-answer-how-to.png)\\n\\nIf a user went back to an answered question, the page will prompt them to edit their exisitng answer instead of adding a new one. \\n\\nIf the button is switched off, there\'ll be 2 options provided. Once user clicked Add another answer, there\'ll be a  pop-up window shown, suggesting user to edit previous answer.\\n\\n![Switch off Button](switched-off-options.gif)\\n\\n## Admin Takes Control of Access\\nWe heard the voice of the [community](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/issues/565), and valued the privacy and security of a Q&A platform. Now, admins have the access to disable the default password login form, having more control over who can and how to access the platform.\\n\\n### How to\\n1. Admin - Settings - Login\\n2. Switch off the Password login.\\nTurning off this option might lock you out if you haven\'t set up another way to log in. A friendly reminder to add a backup login option here.\\n\\n![Reminder](turn-off-reminder.png)\\n\\n## Tweaks. Fixes. Improvements.\\nSometimes, a small change can make a difference to your knowledge journey, and here they are. \\n\\n### Clearer Space for Comment and Answer\\nThe comment used to be blending in a bit before. Now with the grey shadow behind, you can easily identify the answer and comment.  \\n\\n![Clearer Space for Answer and Comment](clearer-answer-comment.png)\\n\\n### Synonym Support for Tag Search\\nWe all have abbreviations or nicknames for some tags, and now you can add synonyms for a single tag.\\n\\n![Add Synonym for Tag](tag-search-synonym.gif)\\n\\nNext time, feel free to search for the tag in the tag page, or the post page easily without recalling the exact names of the tag.\\n\\n### Powered Up Dashboard\\nShare or tuck your Answer away by choosing the running **Public/Private** mode. Database version and size info are ready for your glance, while you can easily access different resources in Answer links.\\n\\n![New Dashboard](new-dashboard.jpeg)\\n\\n### Faster Discovery of Similar Questions\\nWe\'re refining how you experience similar questions. To bring you more focused answers, we\'ll wait until you\'ve typed at least 10 characters. Then we\'ll showcase fresh results when any appear. Hit the existing questions and get the answer without repetitive editing. Set both users and admins\' hands free.  \\n\\n![Search Similar Question](search-similar-question.png)\\n\\n## Cheers.

Now that we finally [shipped it](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/07/a-new-chapter-begins-answer-first-apache-release-launches), and look back to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt during the process. We\u2019ve been received help from other projects, so it\u2019s our chance to pave the way for more projects by sharing our experience. \\n\\nTo the future incubator projects: Consider this blog post your guide as you embark on your own first Apache release. Have a smooth release!\\n\\n## How Do We Collaborate\\nThe driving force behind this release are the 4 PMC members: [LinkinStars](https://github.com/LinkinStars), [shuashuai](https://github.com/shuashuai), [fenbox](https://github.com/fenbox), and [AnnaPrimma](https://github.com/PrimmaAnna), and here\u2019s how they collaborate:\\nfenbox: the architect, planing and crafting the new features.\\nLinkinStars: guardian of compliance, meticulous source code and binary package management.\\nshuashuai: front-end developer, fix bugs, iterate new features, keep flawless user experience, etc.\\nAnnaPrimma: the doc searcher, translator, and past project experience capturer.\\n\\n## New Changes\\nThere are basically two significant changes: **compliance and the voting process**, and we\u2019ve spent plenty of time on them. \\n\\n### Compliance\\nApache releases are required to comply with the Apache Software Foundation\'s (ASF) policies and procedures. One of the most important compliance requirements is that all **dependencies must also be compliant**.\\n\\nBefore we officially launch the release vote, we focused on compliance, as these are the basic requirements before the release. This includes:\\n\\n* Review and organize the Notice and LICENSE files\\n* Add the Apache License Header to all files\\n* Check the compliance of third-party libraries\\n\\nWe also checked on docs, seemed help from mentors via emails, and traced back to other project\u2019s releases. \\n\\n### Process \\nThe release process was extended because of the need of [Apache voting process](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html).\\n\\nThough not compulsory, it is recommended to have discussion in the community via mail list before voting. The first round of voting was conducted by the Project Management Committee (PMC), and the second round of voting was conducted by the Mentors. Voting periods should generally run for **at least 72 hours** to provide an opportunity for all concerned individuals to participate, regardless of their geographic location. A vote is considered successful if it receives at least three positive binding votes (+1).\\n\\n![Release Process](Release%20Process.png)\\n\\nWe were in a bit of a rush to close the voting when we received 3 votes of approval, and were told by another mentor. Please wait at least 72 hours after each round of voting before sending an email to announce the results and close the vote.\\n\\nBesides the release version number, don\u2019t forget to specify the commit ID of the last commit for the current version and the build node that was used to build the current version. \\n\\n## Things We Would Love to Share \\nHere are some takeaways from the release process. Hope it helps ;)\\n\\n### Email. Email. Email. \\nApache projects use mailing lists to coordinate development of their software and administer their organization. Mailing lists also serve as a primary support channel where users can help each other learn to use the software.\\n\\nWe spent a bit of time getting used to email communication, since we were used to instant communication tools. Email is a great way to reduce the information gap for current community members and new members. \\n\\n### Try First, Ask Later.\\nFor uncertain questions, try them first and then ask for your mentor\'s help if needed. Your mentors are here to guide and support, not to do all the work for you.\\n\\n### Be Patient and Seek Help from the Mentors\\nIf you\u2019ve tried but failed to find a solution, reach out to your mentor by email. \\nIn the initial phase of the release, one of the obstacles we faced was the format of the license. We first looked at some graduated projects, but turned out that each project had its format. Then, we decided to display the following information for each license: `(License Category) Packagename (Repository URL) [link](reference link)`. We sent an email for mentors\u2019 advice, and in the end we replaced the LICENSE application URL with the URL we have sorted out.\\n\\nIt finally looks like [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/main/docs/release/LICENSE). As you can see, classifying and organising licenses is something that takes a lot of patience.\\n\\n### Careful with the Assignment\\nIn the past, we simply assigned an issue to the person in charge. However, this approach is not community-driven today. Always remind yourself that: **Issues and pull requests should only be assigned to users who have volunteered to take them on**. \\n\\n\\n### Community Over Code\\nCommunity is the key to a project\'s success in graduating from Apache, and we\u2019re building our community. For an easy and smooth contribution experience, we collect everything a contributor needs on the [Community page](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing), providing a central hub for information and simplifies the contribution process for everyone.\\n\\n## Recommended Docs for Release\\nhttps://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html        \\nhttps://linkis.apache.org/community/how-to-release/\\n\\nYou can always welcome to check our [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer) for reference.\\n\\n## Ready to shape the future of Q&A Software? \\nWe always have new ideas for Q&A, and plan to release a new version every month. You can find our upcoming plans and join the discussion on our [roadmap](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/projects?query=is%3Aopen). \\n\\nIf you\u2019re a Q&A enthusiast, a developer, or a multilingual speaker, we welcome your contributions, and there\u2019s always a way you can [get involved](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing).

Why hasn\'t my badge appeared yet?\\n\\n The vaunt data pulls took place before the two issues were created. This results in at most a 24-hour delay in when the achievement will be awarded. Achievements would have shown up automatically in the next data pull without any intervention, but Vaunt went ahead and re-ran the data pull operations on our end to trigger the achievement grants.\\n\\n3. Can I still get a badge if my issues aren\'t accepted?\\n\\n It\u2019s hard to say this, but it\u2019s a No.\\n We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug.

Why is Answer\'s plugin system designed in such a way that it seems a bit difficult to use?\\n> 2. How can I implement plugin functionality using Golang?\\n> 3. What exactly does Answer\'s plugin system do when it is compiled and packaged?\\n\\n## Background\\nYou can build a Q&A community using Answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.\\nTherefore, we need to design a plugin system to extend its features.\\nAs you may know, Answer is built using `React.js` and `Golang`. Both these languages require compilation. So designing a plugin system is a bit difficult.\\n\\n## Goal & Features\\nThe goal of Answer\'s plugin system is to provide a **flexible** and **extendable** architecture that can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Some of the key features of the plugin system include:\\n\\n### Connectors\\nBy default, Answer supports login via email and password. Within the plugin system, developers can easily integrate other authentication, such as GitHub.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-connector.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n### Storage\\nOut of the box, Answer stores files in the local file system. However, there could be scenarios where users might prefer to save their uploaded files to a cloud storage service like `S3`. This can be achieved by the plugin system.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-storage.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Implementation\\nNow, let\'s explore how the plugin system is implemented, followed by the reasons behind our design decisions.\\n\\n### Details\\nThe general process is as follows:\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-build-brief.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in implementing a plugin:\\n\\n1. Generate a `main.go` file.\\n2. Import the specific plugin list.\\n3. Execute `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` to manage dependencies.\\n4. Copy the UI directory.\\n5. Overwrite the `index.ts` file.\\n6. Execute `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to manage the package and build the project.\\n7. Merge the `i18n` file from the plugin with the original `i18n` file.\\n8. Build a new binary.\\n9. Clean up the byproducts generated during the build process.\\n\\n![answer-plugin-build-all.png](answer-plugin-build-all.png)\\n\\n### Reason\\nHere are the reasons behind our design choices:\\n\\n#### Static Compilation\\n> This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.\\n\\n`React.js` and `Golang` both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.\\nSo the plugin system should be a static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.\\n\\n#### Fixed Functionality\\nThe plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.\\nFurthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed. \\nTherefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.\\nIn the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all official plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.\\n\\n#### Extension\\nThe most important capability of a plugin system is its extensibility.\\nA program can\'t provide all the functions that every user wants. \\nHowever, with a plugin system, users can develop their plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.\\n\\n## Reference\\nThe Caddy is a great open-source software that inspired the design of the Answer plugin system.\\nCaddy is a web server that allows developers to extend its functionality using plugins. \\nUsing [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/) can easy to make custom builds of the Caddy Web Server. \\n \\n## More\\nIn this blog post, we discussed the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, a popular open-source Q&A platform. \\nWe discussed the motivation behind the design, and the features and principles of the plugin system, and provided a step-by-step guide on implementation. \\nIf you are interested in developing plugins for Answer, please feel free to leave us a comment. \\nWe will also write an article on how to implement an Answer plugin from scratch, so stay focused!"},{"id":"/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","title":"How to Utilize Reputation and Privilege in Online Community","description":"Meet Answer\u2019s reputation and privilege systems and automate them for efficient community content management.

Community members establish this based on their actions and contributions. Simultaneously, a reputation system is formed to track participants\' trustworthiness, credibility, and behavior.\\n\\nBesides [tagging](../2023-07-11-the-what-why-using-tags-for-online-community/index.md), [reputation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation) is an important part of **content management** in Answer. Community members gain reputation scores by adhering to community guidelines and continuous contributions. Community moderators and administrators use reputation scores to determine user privileges. This helps run and maintain a healthy community environment and discourages disruptive behavior.\\n\\n## Purposes of Reputation\\n\\nIn the mid-1900s, eBay introduced a feedback system, allowing buyers and sellers to rate each other based on transaction experience. This feedback mechanism, which influenced the reputation of users, helped build trust within the [Q&A platform](../2023-05-12-what-is-q-and-a-platform-and-how-to-use-it/index.md).\\n\\nYou can still find this mechanism running in Answer \u2014 community members upvote question or answer, accept answer, etc. Find out how we implement it for different purposes for a thriving online community.\\n\\n## Ways to Implement Reputation System in Answer\\n\\n### 1. Trust Building\\n\\nA positive reputation indicates credibility, reliability, and expertise. In Answer, you can always find a reputation score next to the name, providing an initial impression of the community member.\\n\\n![Reputation Score Next to Community Member in Answer](TrustBuilding1.png)\\n\\nClick the name and jump to a community member\u2019s profile page, where it includes reputation and related contributions.\\n\\n![Community Member Profile in Answer](TrustBuilding2.png)\\n\\n### 2. Rewards and Penalties\\n\\nAnswer appreciate and encourage positive contributions, such as providing helpful answers, valuable content, upvote useful answers. Meanwhile, negative actions like downvote, spamming or abusive behavior can result in reputation penalties.\\n\\n![Reputation Rules in Answer](RewardsandPenalties.png)\\n\\nClick [here](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation) for Answer\'s complete reputation rules that might inspire you.\\n\\n### 3. Moderation and Governance\\n\\nAfter activation in Answer, community members will gain 1 reputation score, and are allowed to participate in general activities in the community, such as asking questions, writing answers, upvote comment, etc. Reputation scores are also used by community moderators and administrators to determine user [privileges](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission), such as posting more than 2 links at a time, creating a new tag, etc.\\n\\n![Add a New Tag in Answer](AddaNewTag.png)\\n\\nIn Answer, you\u2019ll need 125 reputation scores to downvote, while downvote someone\u2019s answer will reduce one reputation score. This prevents malicious downvoting and boosts answers through intentional others\u2019 answers. This helps maintain a healthy community environment and discourage disruptive behavior.\\n\\nThe scale of communities is different, so is the reputation system. We\u2019ve prepared 3 different privilege levels for teams at different scales.\\n\\n![Levels of Privileges in Answer](LevelsofPrivileges.png)\\n\\n### 4. Community Engagement\\n\\nThe reputation system allows community members to actively engage in the community. They can share expertise, contribute to discussions, and vote for better answers, fostering a positive and collaborative environment.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReputation in an online community is a reflection of a user\u2019s contributions, engagement, and commitment to the community. We know the reputation system is dynamic, and it\u2019s hard to build one from the ground, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve already got a complete [reputation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation) and [permission](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission) rules for you, and it runs perfectly fine in our [official community](https://meta.answer.dev/).\\n\\nBy the time you [install](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation) Answer successfully, the reputation system is already there.

It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.\\n\\nWhen building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  \\n\\n**What types of answers or help do users require?**\\n**How can they always get the answers they require?**\\n**How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?**\\n\\nNo worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.\\n\\n## Why Answer for a Help Center?\\n\\nHere\u2019s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again.\\n\\n![Traditional Help Center](HowHelpCenterWorks.png)\\n\\nAs the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.\\n\\nHowever, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.\\nIn Answer, **everyone can ask and respond**, creating a mutual way interaction.

Effective knowledge sharing increases productivity, and enhances collaboration within your team.\\n\\nAnswer was inspired by the inherent openness of Q&A platforms and communities. As the team behind Answer, we appreciate and embody the spirit of knowledge sharing when tuning Answer.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore types of knowledge, ways of knowledge sharing, and strategies to improve knowledge sharing for your team with Answer.\\n\\n## What is Knowledge Sharing?\\n\\n[![Knowledge Sharing](knowledgesharing1.jpeg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140596819595429978/)\\n\\n[Knowledge Sharing\xa0Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations.\\n\\nAnswer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date.\\n\\n## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing\\n\\n01. Explicit Knowledge\\n Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.\\n Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.\\n   ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)\\n\\n02. Implicit Knowledge\\n The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and \\"know-how\\" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.\\n Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.\\n    ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)\\n\\n03. Tacit Knowledge\\n Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.\\n Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.\\n   ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)\\n\\n## Effective Knowledge Sharing with Answer\\n\\nNo matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team.\\n\\nEffective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here\u2019s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.\\n\\n1. Open and Collaborative Culture\\n Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&A platform itself is open and collaborative.\\n In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.\\n ![Customize Right Sidebar](knowledgesharing5.png)\\n You can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.\\n ![Alt text](knowledgesharing6.png)\\n  \\n2. Make Knowledge Accessible\\n In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.\\n ![Answer a Question](knowledgesharing7.png)\\n\\n Admin can also add wikis, FAQ for users in the sidebar to provide relevant knowledge.\\n ![Customize Left Sidebar](knowledgesharing8.png)\\n\\n3. Effective Knowledge Management  \\n Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.\\n ![Tags with Post](knowledgesharing9.png)\\n Managing tags is also easy. Admins can add, edit or remove a tag in one place.\\n ![Manage Tags](knowledgesharing10.png)\\n4. Recognition and Rewards\\n Express gratitude to the contributors and experts.\\n In Answer, we\u2019ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It\u2019s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you\u2019ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other\u2019s question, etc.\\n\\n5. Feedback and Evaluation  \\n Encouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you\'ve obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstand three types of knowledge and find an effective way to share in the team. Answer is always here to help. Discover a new era of knowledge sharing with Answer, and there are more features waiting for you. By harnessing the power of this dynamic Q&A platform, you can unlock exchange expertise, foster collaboration, and sharing knowledge effectively like never before.\\n\\nLet\u2019s [get started](https://answer.apache.org/docs)."},{"id":"/2023/06/15/answer-1.1.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/15/answer-1.1.0-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-website/edit/main/blog/2023-06-15-answer-1.1.0-release/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-15-answer-1.1.0-release/index.md","title":"Meet Answer 1.1.0: Your Q&A Community Takes a Step Forward","description":"Answer 1.1.0 is now on GitHub, find out the updates and boost productivity with it.","date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 15, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.415,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Meet Answer 1.1.0: Your Q&A Community Takes a Step Forward","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Release","featured":true,"image":"2023-06-15-cover@4x.png","description":"Answer 1.1.0 is now on GitHub, find out the updates and boost productivity with it."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Improve Knowledge Sharing with Answer","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/20/how-to-improve-knowledge-sharing-with-answer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Everything You Need to Know About Knowledge Base","permalink":"/blog/2023/05/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-knowledge-base"}},"content":"We made it, and it\u2019s official here: Answer v1.1.0 is now available on GitHub.\\n  \\nFrom 1.0 to 1.1.0, it\'s not just a stack-up of numbers, but a step forward for your Answer in: **security, functionality, and stability**.
