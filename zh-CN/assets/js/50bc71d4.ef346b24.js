We had the privilege of participating in two incredible events: [WeAreDev World Congress 2024](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress) and [CommunityOverCode Asia 2024](https://asia.communityovercode.org/).\\n\\nWe were grateful to be given these chances. In this blog, we would love to share tips here for more open-source projects showcasing themselves on the stage next time. \\n\\n## WeAreDev World Congress GitHub Open Source Spotlight \\nAs world\u2019s leading event for developers and tech decision-makers, WeAreDev World Congress welcomes more than 15,000 developers and over 500 speakers sharing their expertise and visions of future trends in modern software development. \\n\\n![Alt text](WeAreDev%20World%20Congress.JPG)\\n\\nThis year, GitHub Open Source Spotlight was a part of this congress. We submitted our application and were chosen and offered a space at GitHub booth. It was an unbelievable opportunity to showcase Apache Answer to a global audience of over 15,000 developers and tech leaders. Not to mention, with other brilliant open-source projects. \\n\\n![Alt text](GitHub%20Open%20Source%20Spotlight%20Area.jpeg)\\n\\nThe event provided a valuable opportunity to showcase Answer to potential users, contributors, and industry experts. We gained valuable insights and feedback that will help us shape Answer in a better way. Guess what, we even met several users from Germany!\\n\\n![Alt text](Answer%20at%20GitHub%20Open%20Source%20Spotlight.jpeg)\\n\\n## CommunityOverCode Asia 2024\\nCommunityOverCode (formly known as ApacheCon) is the official global conference series of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Since 1998 \u2013 before the ASF\u2019s incorporation \u2013 ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore \\"Tomorrow\u2019s Technology Today\\" across 300+ Apache projects and their diverse communities. CommunityOverCode showcases the latest developments in Apache projects and emerging innovations through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, and more.\\n\\n![Alt text](CoC%20Asia%202024.jpg)\\n\\nWe had a booth and 3 speeches in keynote, incubator, and community track. We were happy to catch up with our mentors. At the booth, our committers were grateful to connect and answer questions with committers from other Apache projects.\\n\\n\\n## Tips for Better Showcasing Your Projects Events\\nHere, we would love to share some tips for more open-source projects to prepare and show their projects in their next big event. \\n\\n### Share on Social Media \\nMake the best use of social media to extend the reach, especially for global community members. Send an event preview, schedule, and invitation to your followers to drop by and connect. \\n\\n![Alt text](Event%20Preview.png)\\n\\nDuring the event, greet, share the location, and tell them you\u2019ll be staying in the coming days on social media. Check out how our open-source neighbor Open Feature did on day 1 of the congress. \\n\\n![Alt text](Open%20Feature%20Tweet.png)\\n\\n### Show Your Project with a Demo\\nIn GitHub Open Source Spotlight area, we were offered a table with space for a laptop and keyboard connected to a display. \\n\\nA live demo is invaluable, and Meta Answer is the demo already. We ran [Meta Answer\xa0](https://meta.answer.dev/)directly for visitors to explore and we can respond to their questions or record suggestion during the process.\\n\\n![Alt text](Demo%20on%20Display.jpg)\\n\\nIf there\u2019s no connected display on the booth, feel free to bring a portable display, or simply run it on your laptop.\\n\\n![Alt text](Demo%20on%20Laptop.png)\\n\\n### Prepare Some Takeaways\\nWhile the demo is a live experience for the visitors, prepare takeaways for them to recall your project. Flyers and several stickers are efficient. \\n\\nFlyers can provide a quick overview of your project. You can include highlights, social media accounts, and fun facts on the flyers. Stickers are a fun way to leave a lasting impression, and a way to promote your product on the surface of a laptop. \\n\\n![Alt text](Flyer.png)\\n\\nRushing for our flight, we left a \\"help yourself\\" note with our flyers and stickers.\\n\\n![Alt text](Help%20Yourself.png)\\n\\nYou can also make pins, badge, or mug based on the budget. In CommunityOverCode 2024, the fridge magnets at [GreptimeDB](https://greptime.com/) booth were a delight by the look and value.\\n\\n![Alt text](Magnet%20from%20GreptimeDB.png)\\n\\n### Jot Down the Notes\\nListen and record questions, suggestions, and feedback. Categorize and share it with the community. Ask community members to discuss or leave the answers, and vote for the best answers. Gradually, you will have a FAQ list for your next event so that whoever participates the conference can prepare in advance for the questions. \\n\\n*Sounds familiar, right? Answer is a great tool for this.*\\n\\n## See You on Stage\\nWe hope these tips help your open-source project shine at the next big event. Remember, it\'s all about making meaningful connections and showcasing the value you bring to the developer community.\\n\\nParticipating in these events was unforgettable for our team, and we\'re excited to continue contributing to the open-source ecosystem.\\n\\nPlease don\'t hesitate to reach out to us through our [social media](https://x.com/AnswerDev) or our [community](https://meta.answer.dev/)."},{"id":"/2024/08/01/answer-recap-july","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2024/08/01/answer-recap-july","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024-08-01-answer-recap-july/index.mdx","title":"Recap of July | Apache Answer","description":"July was a month all about community love.","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2024\u5e748\u67081\u65e5","tags":[],"readingTime":2.21,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Recap of July | Apache Answer","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Newsletter","featured":false,"image":"2024-08-01-cover@4x.png","description":"July was a month all about community love."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reflection and Our Tips for Your Next Open-Source Events","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2024/08/14/reflection-and-tips-for-your-next-open-source-events"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apache Answer \u9080\u4f60\u5171\u8d74 CommunityOverCode Asia 2024","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2024/07/11/apache-answer-coc-asia-2024"}},"content":"Another page turns, and it was a busy month with some petit milestones.

This is perhaps our very first time to release a new version in the very beginning of a month. \\n\\nIn this update, both users and admins have more freedom to customize, express, and view in the online community with new features. Find out how and why. \\n\\n## Customize URLs with Base Path Parametrization\\nTime to personalize your Answer URL. You can now handle Answer website address by adding tags to URLs. It\u2019s a great improvement for both the flexibility and ease of deployment for Answer.\\n\\n## Express Your Attitude with Reactions\\nWhen you come across a question that aligns perfectly with your confusion, or a brilliant answer that wipes away your doubts, simply show your appreciation with the latest reaction. \\n\\n![Add Reaction in Apache Answer](Add%20Reactions.gif)\\n\\n## Better Content Showcase\\nWe heard your [call](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/issues/84), and here we are. Now, knowledge sharing is at the next level with a new embed plugin. It helps to refer to relevant article, tutorials, coding snippets, etc. \\n\\nAfter activate the [embed plugin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/embed-basic), you can customize the title with a brief summary of the content, and then paste the URL of the content you are adding.  \\n![Use Embed Plugin](Embed%20Plugin.gif)\\n\\nIt looks like this. Better than multiple cold links, right?  \\n![Embed Preview in Apache Answer](Embed%20Look.png)\\n\\n*Click [here](https://answer.apache.org/docs/plugins) for using plugin tutorial.*\\n\\n## Tweaks and Fixes\\nWe\u2019ve made changes to the Active list to ensure it shows current and engaging posts. Old questions will be moved out automatically that are either created 180 days ago, or not received a new answer in the past 90 days. Now, your Answer always shows the most recent topics and discussion when clicking Active. \\n\\nWe understand the need for an easy email address update. Users can now request their email address to be updated through a simple process involving contacting an admin.\\n\\n![Edit Profile](Edit%20Profile.png)\\n\\nIssue such as invalid link, incomplete display, and incorrect count are all fixed! If you spot a bug, don\u2019t hesitate to report it [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/issues). \\n\\n## Here\u2019s to You. Amazing Contributors!\\nWe couldn\u2019t have done it without the dedication and hard work from the community.

Users can also mention the admin and moderator in comments of a post to seek response actively. New Captcha plugins are ready to safeguard your community. \\n\\nReady to [upgrade](https://answer.apache.org/docs/upgrade)? Leave us several minutes to dive in.\\n\\n## What\u2019s New\\n### Keyword Censorship for Secure Communities\\nApache Answer is for open knowledge exchange and discussion respectfully. Keyword censorship helps achieve this by proactively filtering out offensive, discriminatory, or harassing content. It ensures a platform where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves freely.\\nHere\u2019s how it works.\\n1. Admin can develop a keyword list of the community to check or filter.\\n2. Then, go **Admin -\\\\> Plugin -\\\\> Review Basic** where you can add these keywords in **Review** post keywords or **Disallowed** post keywords based on your need. One keyword or IP address per line. Scroll and click **Save**.  \\n\\t![Keyword List to Review](Keyword%20Censorship.png)\\n3. Content, IP addresses, or browser identifiers that contain any of these words will be sent to the review queue or deleted. It will match the internal words. For example, if \\"alpha\\" is not allowed, then \\"Alphabet\\" is also not allowed.  \\n    ![Review](Review.png)\\n\\nThis feature would allow administrators to review or filter out specific words or phrases, potentially creating safe spaces for younger audiences or communities with content restrictions.\\n\\n### Tag Moderators and Admin in Comment\\nNow, you can mention moderator or admin in a comment of a post. As you type the first letter of the moderator or admin\'s username, a search bar will appear. Select the admin/moderator from the dropdown list for a faster response. \\n\\n![Mention Moderator and Admins](Mention%20Moderators%20and%20Admin.png)\\n\\nThe moderator and admins will receive an email in their email box.\\n\\n\\n### Shining on Social Platforms\\nSocial media meta tag is on the stage! Let\u2019s make your shared content appears more attractive on social media platforms. Social meta tags use the following defaults:\\n* Title: the title of current page\\n* Image: the logo of the site\\n\\nShare it and don\u2019t forget to mention us on [Twitter](https://x.com/AnswerDev). \\n\\n## Improvements and Fixed Bugs\\nWe\u2019ve got new plugins for you: [Captcha Basic](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/captcha-basic) and [Captcha Google V2](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer-plugins/tree/main/captcha-google-v2).

From overwhelming during our first release, we are now out of the woods.\\n\\nSpeaking of releases, we can\u2019t neglect Release Manager. The person who makes sure that everything is compliant and everyone can access to the latest version. We talked to LinkinStars, the conductor behind each Apache Answer release. Let\'s see how he sees this role, how he handles obstacles, and his secrets to a smooth release.\\n\\n## Tell us a bit about yourself\\nI am the backend developer for Apache Answer. My daily routine includes developing the backend services of Answer, developing APIs, etc. I like coding, reading, and learning English. My tech stack is mainly Go, and my favorite open-source project is Kubernetes.\\n\\n## What makes you the release manager of Apache Answer, and what do you think of this role?\\nUsually, a backend engineer is responsible for the compilation, packaging, and deployment of the project. That\u2019s why I am here. \\n\\nThis role itself requires lots of patience and carefulness. Each package needs to be carefully checked to ensure that all the required files are correct and compliant. Release managers have a lot on their plate, since the releasing problems will lead to user upgrade or usage issues.\\n\\n## Can you briefly walk us through the release process? Which stages are more critical?\\nSure. The release process of Apache Answer consists of the following stages.\\n\\n![Release Process of Apache Answer](release-process.png)\\n\\nThe most important stage is actually the **preparation**. It involves preparation and review of all the content that needs to be released. We have to check and review the open-source requirements, license, signature, etc. If this stage is not well checked, we cannot pass the voting afterward.\\n\\n## Which tools/platforms do you use to release?\\nWe use GitHub Actions to build the packages and release.\\n\\n## What are the key factors for a successful release?\\nThe 2 key factors for a successful release are:\\n\\n**Check once, check twice, and check from the top again.**\\n**Test, test again, and another round of tests.**\\n\\nNo worries, as soon as you have released the first Apache version, things get easier and smoother. \\n\\n## How do you prioritize the tasks in the release process?\\nHandling multiple tasks happens occasionally, and here\u2019s how I manage them.\\n\\nOnce we decide to release the version, and there might still be new issues coming from the users. In this case, if there\u2019s no urgent bugs that need to be fixed, we will put them into the to-dos of the next version and move on. \\n\\n## How do you handle \\"unexpected events\\" during the release process?\\nSeek help from the mentors.        \\nI will ask them to locate the problem and help with the review. Then, we will fix it, and re-initiate the voting. \\n\\n## Can you share one of the most difficult challenges you faced during the release process, and how did you nail it?\\nThe most enduring challenge I faced was the first release. I had no idea about preparation, what to expect, and what\u2019s next. Here\u2019s how I manage to overcome the challenges with the team.\\n1. Collect and organize all the documents related to Apache releases.\\n2. Look into the release notes and emails of other Apache projects for reference.\\n3. Seek help from the mentors via emails.\\n\\nThe most important thing is to **keep trying**. The Apache community is friendly, and community members will remind you with assistance. Be brave, and embrace the mistakes. \\n\\n*Find out how we launched the first Apache Release [here](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/13/behind-the-scene-how-we-launched-the-first-apache-release).*\\n\\n## What are some strategies/tips you have for working effectively with your team during the release process?\\n1. Use GitHub issues and projects to manage all the released content, and then check one by one with each team member.\\n\\n2. Provide as much context as possible when describing an issue. This is particularly useful in email communication, as the more context leads to less misunderstanding and saves time.   \\n\\n## What do you find most rewarding about being a Release Manager?\\nIt\'s fulfilling to fix all the problems in a project after rounds of revisions, and a successful release. To receive feedback from the users is absolutely rewarding."},{"id":"/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2024/02/20/answer-1.2.5-is-ready","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024-02-20-answer-1.2.5-is-ready/index.md","title":"Answer 1.2.5 is Ready","description":"Answer supports dark mode and plugin notification.

Of course, you can use other tools to deploy Answer with HTTPS, such as Nginx, etc.\\n\\n## Preparation\\n1. You can follow the [installation guide](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation/) to install Answer. After installing Answer, you can access it using HTTP. The default port for Answer is 9080. You can access it at http://localhost:9080. In the following steps, we will use 9080 as the default port for Answer.\\n\\n2. You need a domain that **DNS resolution is already configured to point to your server**.\\n\\n3. In this blog we will use docker-compose to install Caddy. So we need docker and docker-compose. You can follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install docker and docker-compose.\\n\\n## Deploy \\n\\n### Step 1\\n```shell\\n$ mkdir caddy-docker\\n$ cd caddy-docker\\n$ vim docker-compose.yml\\n```\\nYou can create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the new directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"docker-compose.yml\\"\\nversion: \\"3.7\\"\\n\\nservices:\\n  caddy:\\n    image: caddy\\n    restart: unless-stopped\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"80:80\\"\\n      - \\"443:443\\"\\n      - \\"443:443/udp\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\\n      - $PWD/caddy_data:/data\\n      - $PWD/caddy_config:/config\\n    network_mode: host\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2\\nThe `Caddyfile` is the configuration file for Caddy. It is used to configure how Caddy should serve your site. This file will be mounted into the container at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ vim Caddyfile\\n```\\nCreate `Caddyfile` file in the same directory, and then add the following code:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3\\n\\nRun the following command to start Caddy. Wait a few seconds, and then you can access Answer using HTTPS.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose up -d\\n```\\n\\nIf you can\'t access it, you can check the logs of Caddy.\\n\\n```shell\\n$ docker-compose logs\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced\\nIf you don\'t want to use `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml`, you can put Answer and Caddy in the same docker compose. Then Caddy and Answer can use the same network. So you can configure Caddy like this:\\n\\n```text title=\\"Caddyfile\\"\\nyour.answer.domain {\\n    reverse_proxy answer-service:9080\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOf course, you can also install Caddy using other methods, such as using the binary file, etc. All in all, I wish you can follow this blog to deploy Answer with HTTPS successfully.

We will try our best to help you."},{"id":"/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2024/01/25/first-contribution-come-to-answer","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2024-01-25-first-contribution-come-to-answer/index.md","title":"First Contribution?

We all have new questions or new answers at the beginning of the year, and feel free to raise your hand in the first release of Answer in 2024.\\n\\nIn this version, we pack up new features and improvements to make finding answers easier, reduce duplicate content, and an efficient way of organizing your Q&A knowledge from the very start. \\n\\n## One Answer. One Question.\\nAnswer focuses on clear and concise answers to each question. However, you can find new answers or scattered answers from one person in several responses, making it hard for the admin to pick the best answer, and maintain the content afterwards. \\n\\nWe\'ve streamlined things so everyone can write or edit one, top-notch answer to each question. This helps users focus on contributing their expertise, and lets the best answer shine.\\n\\n### How to\\nThis feature is on by default, and admin can switch it off anytime. \\n1. Go Admin - Settings - Write.\\n2. Switch the button.\\n\\n![Switch on One Answer Only](one-answer-how-to.png)\\n\\nIf a user went back to an answered question, the page will prompt them to edit their exisitng answer instead of adding a new one. \\n\\nIf the button is switched off, there\'ll be 2 options provided. Once user clicked Add another answer, there\'ll be a  pop-up window shown, suggesting user to edit previous answer.\\n\\n![Switch off Button](switched-off-options.gif)\\n\\n## Admin Takes Control of Access\\nWe heard the voice of the [community](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/issues/565), and valued the privacy and security of a Q&A platform. Now, admins have the access to disable the default password login form, having more control over who can and how to access the platform.\\n\\n### How to\\n1. Admin - Settings - Login\\n2. Switch off the Password login.\\nTurning off this option might lock you out if you haven\'t set up another way to log in. A friendly reminder to add a backup login option here.\\n\\n![Reminder](turn-off-reminder.png)\\n\\n## Tweaks. Fixes. Improvements.\\nSometimes, a small change can make a difference to your knowledge journey, and here they are. \\n\\n### Clearer Space for Comment and Answer\\nThe comment used to be blending in a bit before. Now with the grey shadow behind, you can easily identify the answer and comment.  \\n\\n![Clearer Space for Answer and Comment](clearer-answer-comment.png)\\n\\n### Synonym Support for Tag Search\\nWe all have abbreviations or nicknames for some tags, and now you can add synonyms for a single tag.\\n\\n![Add Synonym for Tag](tag-search-synonym.gif)\\n\\nNext time, feel free to search for the tag in the tag page, or the post page easily without recalling the exact names of the tag.\\n\\n### Powered Up Dashboard\\nShare or tuck your Answer away by choosing the running **Public/Private** mode. Database version and size info are ready for your glance, while you can easily access different resources in Answer links.\\n\\n![New Dashboard](new-dashboard.jpeg)\\n\\n### Faster Discovery of Similar Questions\\nWe\'re refining how you experience similar questions. To bring you more focused answers, we\'ll wait until you\'ve typed at least 10 characters. Then we\'ll showcase fresh results when any appear. Hit the existing questions and get the answer without repetitive editing. Set both users and admins\' hands free.  \\n\\n![Search Similar Question](search-similar-question.png)\\n\\n## Cheers.

Now that we finally [shipped it](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/12/07/a-new-chapter-begins-answer-first-apache-release-launches), and look back to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt during the process. We\u2019ve been received help from other projects, so it\u2019s our chance to pave the way for more projects by sharing our experience. \\n\\nTo the future incubator projects: Consider this blog post your guide as you embark on your own first Apache release. Have a smooth release!\\n\\n## How Do We Collaborate\\nThe driving force behind this release are the 4 PMC members: [LinkinStars](https://github.com/LinkinStars), [shuashuai](https://github.com/shuashuai), [fenbox](https://github.com/fenbox), and [AnnaPrimma](https://github.com/PrimmaAnna), and here\u2019s how they collaborate:\\nfenbox: the architect, planing and crafting the new features.\\nLinkinStars: guardian of compliance, meticulous source code and binary package management.\\nshuashuai: front-end developer, fix bugs, iterate new features, keep flawless user experience, etc.\\nAnnaPrimma: the doc searcher, translator, and past project experience capturer.\\n\\n## New Changes\\nThere are basically two significant changes: **compliance and the voting process**, and we\u2019ve spent plenty of time on them. \\n\\n### Compliance\\nApache releases are required to comply with the Apache Software Foundation\'s (ASF) policies and procedures. One of the most important compliance requirements is that all **dependencies must also be compliant**.\\n\\nBefore we officially launch the release vote, we focused on compliance, as these are the basic requirements before the release. This includes:\\n\\n* Review and organize the Notice and LICENSE files\\n* Add the Apache License Header to all files\\n* Check the compliance of third-party libraries\\n\\nWe also checked on docs, seemed help from mentors via emails, and traced back to other project\u2019s releases. \\n\\n### Process \\nThe release process was extended because of the need of [Apache voting process](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html).\\n\\nThough not compulsory, it is recommended to have discussion in the community via mail list before voting. The first round of voting was conducted by the Project Management Committee (PMC), and the second round of voting was conducted by the Mentors. Voting periods should generally run for **at least 72 hours** to provide an opportunity for all concerned individuals to participate, regardless of their geographic location. A vote is considered successful if it receives at least three positive binding votes (+1).\\n\\n![Release Process](Release%20Process.png)\\n\\nWe were in a bit of a rush to close the voting when we received 3 votes of approval, and were told by another mentor. Please wait at least 72 hours after each round of voting before sending an email to announce the results and close the vote.\\n\\nBesides the release version number, don\u2019t forget to specify the commit ID of the last commit for the current version and the build node that was used to build the current version. \\n\\n## Things We Would Love to Share \\nHere are some takeaways from the release process. Hope it helps ;)\\n\\n### Email. Email. Email. \\nApache projects use mailing lists to coordinate development of their software and administer their organization. Mailing lists also serve as a primary support channel where users can help each other learn to use the software.\\n\\nWe spent a bit of time getting used to email communication, since we were used to instant communication tools. Email is a great way to reduce the information gap for current community members and new members. \\n\\n### Try First, Ask Later.\\nFor uncertain questions, try them first and then ask for your mentor\'s help if needed. Your mentors are here to guide and support, not to do all the work for you.\\n\\n### Be Patient and Seek Help from the Mentors\\nIf you\u2019ve tried but failed to find a solution, reach out to your mentor by email. \\nIn the initial phase of the release, one of the obstacles we faced was the format of the license. We first looked at some graduated projects, but turned out that each project had its format. Then, we decided to display the following information for each license: `(License Category) Packagename (Repository URL) [link](reference link)`. We sent an email for mentors\u2019 advice, and in the end we replaced the LICENSE application URL with the URL we have sorted out.\\n\\nIt finally looks like [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/blob/main/docs/release/LICENSE). As you can see, classifying and organising licenses is something that takes a lot of patience.\\n\\n### Careful with the Assignment\\nIn the past, we simply assigned an issue to the person in charge. However, this approach is not community-driven today. Always remind yourself that: **Issues and pull requests should only be assigned to users who have volunteered to take them on**. \\n\\n\\n### Community Over Code\\nCommunity is the key to a project\'s success in graduating from Apache, and we\u2019re building our community. For an easy and smooth contribution experience, we collect everything a contributor needs on the [Community page](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing), providing a central hub for information and simplifies the contribution process for everyone.\\n\\n## Recommended Docs for Release\\nhttps://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html        \\nhttps://linkis.apache.org/community/how-to-release/\\n\\nYou can always welcome to check our [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer) for reference.\\n\\n## Ready to shape the future of Q&A Software? \\nWe always have new ideas for Q&A, and plan to release a new version every month. You can find our upcoming plans and join the discussion on our [roadmap](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/projects?query=is%3Aopen). \\n\\nIf you\u2019re a Q&A enthusiast, a developer, or a multilingual speaker, we welcome your contributions, and there\u2019s always a way you can [get involved](https://answer.apache.org/community/contributing).

Can I still get a badge if my issues aren\'t accepted?\\n\\n It\u2019s hard to say this, but it\u2019s a No.\\n We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug.

Why is Answer\'s plugin system designed in such a way that it seems a bit of difficulty to use?\\n> 2. How can I implement plugin functionality using Golang?\\n> 3. What exactly does Answer\'s plugin system do when it is compiled and packaged?\\n\\n## Background\\nYou can build a Q&A community using answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.\\nTherefore, we need to design a plugin system to extend its features.\\nAs you may know, Answer is built using `React.js` and `Golang`. Both these languages require compilation. So designing a plugin system is a bit difficult.\\n\\n## Goal & Features\\nThe goal of Answer\'s plugin system is to provide a **flexible** and **extendable** architecture that can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Some of the key features of the plugin system include:\\n\\n### Connectors\\nBy default, Answer supports login via email and password. Withing the plugin system, developers can easily integrate other authentication, such as GitHub.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-connector.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n### Storage\\nOut of the box, Answer stores files in the local file system. However, there could be scenarios where users might prefer to save their uploaded files to a cloud storage service like `S3`. This can be achieved by plugin system.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-storage.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Implementation\\nNow, let\'s explore how the plugin system is implemented, followed by the reasons behind our design decisions.\\n\\n### Details\\nThe general process is as follows:\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-build-brief.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in implementing a plugin:\\n\\n1. Generate a `main.go` file.\\n2. Import the specific plugin list.\\n3. Execute `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` to manage dependencies.\\n4. Copy the UI directory.\\n5. Overwrite the `index.ts` file.\\n6. Execute `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to manage the package and build the project.\\n7. Merge the `i18n` file from the plugin with the original `i18n` file.\\n8. Build a new binary.\\n9. Clean up the byproducts generated during the build process.\\n\\n![answer-plugin-build-all.png](answer-plugin-build-all.png)\\n\\n### Reason\\nHere are the reasons behind our design choices:\\n\\n#### Static Compilation\\n> This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.\\n\\n`React.js` and `Golang` both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.\\nSo the plugin system should be static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.\\n\\n#### Fixed Functionality\\nThe plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.\\nFurthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed. \\nTherefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.\\nIn the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all officially plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.\\n\\n#### Extension\\nThe most important capability of a plugin system is actually its extensibility. \\nIt is impossible for a program to provide all the functions that every user wants. \\nHowever, with a plugin system, users can develop their own plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.\\n\\n## Reference\\nThe Caddy is a great open-source software that inspired the design of the Answer plugin system.\\nCaddy is a web server that allows developers to extend its functionality using plugins. \\nUsing [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/) can easy to make custom builds of the Caddy Web Server. \\n \\n## More\\nIn this blog post, we discussed the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, a popular open-source Q&A platform. \\nWe discussed the motivation behind the design, the features and principles of the plugin system, and provided a step-by-step guide on implementation. \\nIf you are interested in developing plugins for Answer, please feel free to leave us a comment. \\nWe will also write an article on how to implement an Answer plugin from scratch, so stay focus!"},{"id":"/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","title":"How to Utilize Reputation and Privilege in Online Community","description":"Meet Answer\u2019s reputation and privilege systems and automate them for efficient community content management.

Simultaneously, a reputation system is formed to track participants\' trustworthiness, credibility, and behavior.\\n\\nBesides [tagging](../2023-07-11-the-what-why-using-tags-for-online-community/index.md), [reputation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation) is an important part of **content management** in Answer. Community members gain reputation scores by adhering to community guidelines and continuous contributions. Community moderators and administrators use reputation scores to determine user privileges. This helps run and maintain a healthy community environment and discourages disruptive behavior.\\n\\n## Purposes of Reputation\\n\\nIn the mid-1900s, eBay introduced a feedback system, allowing buyers and sellers to rate each other based on transaction experience. This feedback mechanism, which influenced the reputation of users, helped build trust within the [Q&A platform](../2023-05-12-what-is-q-and-a-platform-and-how-to-use-it/index.md).\\n\\nYou can still find this mechanism running in Answer \u2014 community members upvote question or answer, accept answer, etc. Find out how we implement it for different purposes for a thriving online community.\\n\\n## Ways to Implement Reputation System in Answer\\n\\n### 1. Trust Building\\n\\nA positive reputation indicates credibility, reliability, and expertise. In Answer, you can always find a reputation score next to the name, providing an initial impression of the community member.\\n\\n![Reputation Score Next to Community Member in Answer](TrustBuilding1.png)\\n\\nClick the name and jump to a community member\u2019s profile page, where it includes reputation and related contributions.\\n\\n![Community Member Profile in Answer](TrustBuilding2.png)\\n\\n### 2.

Moderation and Governance\\n\\nAfter activation in Answer, community members will gain 1 reputation score, and are allowed to participate in general activities in the community, such as asking questions, writing answers, upvote comment, etc. Reputation scores are also used by community moderators and administrators to determine user [privileges](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission), such as posting more than 2 links at a time, creating a new tag, etc.\\n\\n![Add a New Tag in Answer](AddaNewTag.png)\\n\\nIn Answer, you\u2019ll need 125 reputation scores to downvote, while downvote someone\u2019s answer will reduce one reputation score. This prevents malicious downvoting and boosts answers through intentional others\u2019 answers. This helps maintain a healthy community environment and discourage disruptive behavior.\\n\\nThe scale of communities is different, so is the reputation system. We\u2019ve prepared 3 different privilege levels for teams at different scales.\\n\\n![Levels of Privileges in Answer](LevelsofPrivileges.png)\\n\\n### 4. Community Engagement\\n\\nThe reputation system allows community members to actively engage in the community. They can share expertise, contribute to discussions, and vote for better answers, fostering a positive and collaborative environment.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReputation in an online community is a reflection of a user\u2019s contributions, engagement, and commitment to the community. We know the reputation system is dynamic, and it\u2019s hard to build one from the ground, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve already got a complete [reputation](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation) and [permission](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission) rules for you, and it runs perfectly fine in our [official community](https://meta.answer.dev/).\\n\\nBy the time you [install](https://answer.apache.org/docs/installation) Answer successfully, the reputation system is already there.

Obviously, not every question needs a team to solve, which makes self-service effective (a support team is still needed). That\u2019s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers.\\n\\nIn today\u2019s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.\\n\\n## What\u2019s a Help Center\\n\\nA Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.\\n\\nWhen building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  \\n\\n**What types of answers or help do users require?**\\n**How can they always get the answers they require?**\\n**How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?**\\n\\nNo worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.\\n\\n## Why Answer for a Help Center?\\n\\nHere\u2019s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again.\\n\\n![Traditional Help Center](HowHelpCenterWorks.png)\\n\\nAs the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.\\n\\nHowever, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.\\nIn Answer, **everyone can ask and respond**, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.\\n\\n## Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)\\n\\nThe essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this. Here\u2019s how, and you\u2019ll know why.\\n\\n### 01. Start with the FAQs\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to immediately categorize questions in the beginning, why not start with the frequently asked questions? It not only makes sure your content is right for the help center, but also solves the most common issues for your customers at the moment.\\n\\nThe best part in Answer is that, as long as you run a support center with it, gradually you\u2019ll get the FAQ at present because your customers have done it for you ;)\\n\\n![Hot Question in Answer](HotQuestion.png)\\n\\nYou can also [Pin recent FAQs](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new) for your customers, or add as an additional resource in the sidebar, so that users can get the answer they need right away.\\n\\n![Pin an FAQ in Answer](Pin.png)\\n\\n### 02. Make Content Consistent\\n\\nIn Answer, help center is not just about self-service, but also about helping each other. Customers can also write answers to others, then admin and moderator will read and accept the best answers. If the question is answered perfectly in content, but not consistent with your style guide, you can have an admin or moderator to tune and make it looks shining again.\\n\\n![Approved Answer](ApprovedAnswer.png)\\n\\nThere are tips and notice to assist users deliver a concise question, while keeping the help center neat, such as tips for a clear title, format guidance, tag notes, etc.\\n\\n![Tips and Notice in Answer](TipsandNotice.png)\\n\\n### 03. Organize Categories with Tags\\n\\nTime to make informative content easy to store and manage. In Answer, you can create new tags freely: add one in the Tag page, or build a new one right after a post.\\n\\n![Categorize with Tags in Answer](CategorizewithTags.png)\\n\\nAdd a description for your users to know what the tag is about, and what content can they find in this tag. Users can click to view all the related information they require. With filter, they can find the content in the way they want.\\n\\n![Tag and Description in Answer](TagandDescription.png)\\n\\n### 04. Keep the Answers Fresh and Ready\\n\\nDon\u2019t make your help center end up with outdated answers.

Effective knowledge sharing increases productivity, and enhances collaboration within your team.\\n\\nAnswer was inspired by the inherent openness of Q&A platforms and communities. As the team behind Answer, we appreciate and embody the spirit of knowledge sharing when tuning Answer.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore types of knowledge, ways of knowledge sharing, and strategies to improve knowledge sharing for your team with Answer.\\n\\n## What is Knowledge Sharing?\\n\\n[![Knowledge Sharing](knowledgesharing1.jpeg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140596819595429978/)\\n\\n[Knowledge Sharing\xa0Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations.\\n\\nAnswer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date.\\n\\n## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing\\n\\n01. Explicit Knowledge\\n Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.\\n Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.\\n   ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)\\n\\n02. Implicit Knowledge\\n The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and \\"know-how\\" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.\\n Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.\\n    ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)\\n\\n03. Tacit Knowledge\\n Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.\\n Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.\\n   ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)\\n\\n## Effective Knowledge Sharing with Answer\\n\\nNo matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team.\\n\\nEffective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here\u2019s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.\\n\\n1. Open and Collaborative Culture\\n Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&A platform itself is open and collaborative.\\n In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.\\n ![Customize Right Sidebar](knowledgesharing5.png)\\n You can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.\\n ![Alt text](knowledgesharing6.png)\\n  \\n2. Make Knowledge Accessible\\n In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.\\n ![Answer a Question](knowledgesharing7.png)\\n\\n Admin can also add wikis, FAQ for users in the sidebar to provide relevant knowledge.\\n ![Customize Left Sidebar](knowledgesharing8.png)\\n\\n3. Effective Knowledge Management  \\n Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.\\n ![Tags with Post](knowledgesharing9.png)\\n Managing tags is also easy. Admins can add, edit or remove a tag in one place.\\n ![Manage Tags](knowledgesharing10.png)\\n4. Recognition and Rewards\\n Express gratitude to the contributors and experts.\\n In Answer, we\u2019ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It\u2019s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you\u2019ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other\u2019s question, etc.\\n\\n5. Feedback and Evaluation  \\n Encouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you\'ve obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstand three types of knowledge and find an effective way to share in the team. Answer is always here to help. Discover a new era of knowledge sharing with Answer, and there are more features waiting for you. By harnessing the power of this dynamic Q&A platform, you can unlock exchange expertise, foster collaboration, and sharing knowledge effectively like never before.\\n\\nLet\u2019s [get started](https://answer.apache.org/docs)."},{"id":"/2023/06/15/answer-1.1.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/06/15/answer-1.1.0-release","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-06-15-answer-1.1.0-release/index.md","title":"Meet Answer 1.1.0: Your Q&A Community Takes a Step Forward","description":"Answer 1.1.0 is now on GitHub, find out the updates and boost productivity with it.","date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2023\u5e746\u670815\u65e5","tags":[],"readingTime":2.415,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Meet Answer 1.1.0: Your Q&A Community Takes a Step Forward","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Release","featured":true,"image":"2023-06-15-cover@4x.png","description":"Answer 1.1.0 is now on GitHub, find out the updates and boost productivity with it."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to Improve Knowledge Sharing with Answer","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/06/20/how-to-improve-knowledge-sharing-with-answer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Everything You Need to Know About Knowledge Base","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/05/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-knowledge-base"}},"content":"We made it, and it\u2019s official here: Answer v1.1.0 is now available on GitHub.   \\n  \\nFrom 1.0 to 1.1.0, it\'s not just a stack-up of numbers, but a step forward for your Answer in: **security, functionality, and stability**.
